# Project Name: '2048-game'.
## 1. Project Goal:
  - I have implemented the 2048 game according to the provided technical requirements. The game follows the classic rules, where the player can move cells using keyboard arrows, and 2 equal cells merge into a doubled number. The game field is 4x4, and the objective is to reach the 2048 tile. The player's score increases with each move, based on the sum of all merged cells.

## 2. Technologies:
   - JavaScript: The core logic of the game is implemented in JavaScript.
   - HTML/CSS: Basic HTML and CSS are used for structuring and styling the game interface.
   - npm: Node Package Manager is used for managing project dependencies and running tests.
